# MobileArchitect-Programming
From my CS-360 Mobile Architect &amp; Programming class @ SNHU

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of this app was to create an inventory management system that could be used by different types of users.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The login screen is the first screen that you see upon opening the app. This is required to authenticate the user to see their inventory. You are then taken to the inventory display screen where you have different functions available to use. These functions are to Add Item, Delete Item, Update Item, and Enable SMS feature. You have to be able to modify the inventory and this screen does just that. The Enable SMS feature will automatically send a text from your own phone to a number that you assign in the preference dialog screen. I wanted to keep the app simplified and all functionality accessible from the inventory display screen.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I started out with making sure the app was functionally sound. I then moved on to polishing up the design. This makes sure that I don't have to retrace coding the functionality of the app. I could use this technique in the future to remain consistent by not having to backwork the functionality.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I was able to use my personal Android phone to load my app in through Android Studio. I was then able to test all functionality from this device. This process is important because I can test the app just like a user would and fix any bugs that I find.

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to do a lot of reasearch along the way as this way my first Android project. I had to overcome the challenge of also learning about SQLite to integrate a database into my application. I am glad that I was able to work through these challenges as I have now gained a few more skills to my skillset.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was really successful in implementing the read and write commands to my database to make sure inventory was being kept track of properly. I was also easily able to transition between activites to produce the desired functionality.
